This is a script to rename xlhq files and folders according to the
conventions used by the program Forge.
Since at the moment not all correspondences have been established,
it would be best to first download
everything via Forge, then download and rename the xlhq files and
folders with this script and
finally copy them to the Forge directory, overwriting the originals.
Requires python 3.5 and a user with read/write permission to the
destination directory.

Usage:
On linux run in a terminal 'python3 /path/to/rename_sets.py'.
On windows run in terminal 'C:\Python35\python.exe C:\path\rename_sets.py'.
Then finally enter the path to the folder
where the xlhq uncompressed set folders are located,
including the last separator (i. e. '/home/user/Downloads/').
